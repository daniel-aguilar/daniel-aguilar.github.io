title: Resuming the Journey
---

After an extended hiatus, I've decided I'll pick my blog where I left
off.

This time, I've chosen [Jekyll][1] as my blogging tool. I find it much
more appealing than [Wordpress][2], honestly. It has built-in syntax
highlighting, there's no need for a database since everything is written
in plain text files ([Markdown][3] to be specific, which I absolutely
love by the way), and on top of that, I get to keep it inside a git
repository. It almost feels like programming. What more can I ask for?

So now that things are simpler, hopefully this is where I'll resume my
blogging journey.
