## Me

Hi, my name is Daniel Aguilar. I'm a software engineer from [Costa Rica][1].

I like to describe myself as enthusiastic and passionate, and not just about
programming. I'm always looking for ways of bettering myself and improving
things around me.

Reading and learning about new stuff is one of my hobbies. I think learning by
doing is a very effective way of discovering and applying unfamiliar concepts.
I also enjoy teaching and tutoring. You'll find most of my material is focused
around learning resources.

I'm a big fan of free and open source software, and my style of programming is
usually inspired by a strong adherence to existing standards, trying to avoid
reinventing the wheel where possible. My objective is to always do something in
the best achievable way.
