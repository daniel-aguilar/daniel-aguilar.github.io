Hi, my name is Daniel Aguilar. I'm a software developer from
[Costa Rica][costa_rica]. This is my personal blog. I try to keep it technology
related.

Here are some things I like:

* programming
    * unit testing
    * [clean code][clean_code]
* [free software][free_software]
* learning new things
* improving stuff
* reading (books and webcomics)
* driving (specially at night)
* mountain biking
* cats
* Hawaiian pizza
* chocolate milk
* sunsets
* daydreaming
* listening to music
* simplicity & minimalism

This website is built using [Jekyll][jekyll], and is hosted for free at [GitHub
Pages][github_pages].

The emojis used across this website are part of the [twemoji open source emoji
project][twemoji]. The favicon is [Upside-Down Face][1f643], which I like very
much. ðŸ™ƒ

You can check out this website's sources at [this git repository][blog_repo].
