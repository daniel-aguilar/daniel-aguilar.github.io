            JPQL Considered Harmful
          </a>
        </h3><p>In a Java project, it’s not unusual to find database queries using the
Jakarta Persistence Query Language (JPQL), a fairly easy to use
language with a syntax akin to SQL. While this is a perfectly
acceptable way to declare small queries, it can quickly spiral out of
control for more advanced requirements. The Criteria API (and its
Spring Data derivative Specifications) allow for a modular,
programmatic, and type safe declaration of queries. It’s so good,
you’ll probably never want to go back to writing string queries again!</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/effective-use-identity-columns/">
            Effective Use of SQL Identity Columns (Oracle &amp; Postgres)
          </a>
        </h3><p>The concept of SQL tables with an auto incremental column for its
primary key it’s obviously not new, as it is easily implemented using
sequences. Now, on December of 2003 the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/34132.html">SQL:2003</a> standard
introduced the identity column type, along with the syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GENERATED
AS IDENTITY</code>, which is currently supported by virtually all RDBMS
providers. Let’s take a quick look at how we can declare primary key
columns with auto generated identifiers, without relying on
vendor-specific syntax!</p>

        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/oracle-flashback/">
            Going back in time with Oracle Flashback
          </a>
        </h3><p>You ever wished you could take a snapshot of your current Oracle
development database? One that you could easily go back to in case of
trouble. What if you started working on a feature, and accidentally
mess up the business logic integrity in some way? Imagine the
countless hours just trying to revert the damage done only to finally
give up and end up recreating the database from scratch. You ever
wished this could be done in a straightforward way (less than 3
commands)? Me too!</p>

            Introduction to BSD Sockets
          </a>
        </h3><p>The operating system truly makes developers’ jobs much more easier: we don’t
have to worry about the boring details, and can focus on what our programs do
instead. Keeping with the same philosophy of abstracting the details, and thanks
to the people at UC Berkeley, communicating over a network isn’t that much
different as writing some data to a file.</p>

            Container Authentication with Spring Security
          </a>
        </h3><p>Spring Security is a framework full of solid features, most of them working
nearly out of the box. Yet it’s still flexible enough to adapt to your
particular requirements. In this article I’ll demonstrate how to integrate your
Spring application authentication with a servlet container, such as WebSphere
Application Server (WAS) or Tomcat, using Spring Security.</p>

            How to Install Oracle JDK in Ubuntu
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve been a Windows user almost all my life, mainly because I didn’t know
better, and I wasn’t into computers either until later on. When I made the
switch to Ubuntu, one of the pet peeves I had was installing Java. Sure,
installing OpenJDK is very easy, since there’s already a package for it, but
what if you need Oracle’s?</p>

            Handling dotfiles with YADM
          </a>

          <a class="post-link" href="/using-vimrc-files-per-directory/">
            Using vimrc Files per Directory
          </a>
        </h3><p>How many times have you wished you could have a different vimrc
configuration per directory? I know I have, many times! Specially when
you work on different projects which might require different settings.
For instance, I like to enable spell checking when working on my school
notes, but I don’t wanna <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set spell spelllang=es,en</code> every time I open
a file for editing.</p>

            Dockerfile: CMD vs. ENTRYPOINT
          </a>
        </h3><p>Docker provides a couple of instructions to specify what a container
does when you want to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker run</code> it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENTRYPOINT</code>.</p>

            Squashing Old References with Django Migrations
          </a>
        </h3><p>The other day I found a small typo in a function I was referencing in
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upload_to</code> field option in one of my models. I fixed the nasty
typo, only to discover I had broken the migrations, as it was also being
referenced in one of them.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/virtualbox-compacting-disks/">
            VirtualBox: Compacting Disks
          </a>
        </h3><p>VirtualBox’s dynamically allocated disks are great because they start
small, and only stretch when they need to. Thing is, they don’t shrink
back <em>automagically</em> once the space is freed, they require a little
push. This is what VirtualBox calls <em>compacting</em>, and it’s a great way
to trim your machines so they only use as much space as they actually
need.</p>

            Internationalization (i18n) with Yii 2
          </a>
        </h3><p>Yii 2 provides a very intuitive way to translate your web application,
and it makes it easy for both the developers and the translators, by
keeping the work that has to be done by both parties nicely separated.</p>

off.</p>
